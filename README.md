# SurveyApp
SurveyApp is built for sending surveys via email and tracking user feedback. Users are able to quickly send surveys to as many customers as needed, search through sent surveys easily, and track user feedback conveniently. In order to send a survey, the user has to have a minimum number of credits: 1. Before sending a survey, the user can review his survey. 

This application is built using modern Javascript frameworks: ReactJS (for the front-end), and NodeJS (for the back-end) . Application employs advanced Javascript features such as secure authentication using JWT tokens, payments using Stripe, and emailing system implemented using SendGrid. I also implemented one of the more advanced web development concepts: web-hooks, for giving users a chance to give feedback on the surveys straight from their emails. React-Router library is used for effortless navigation. MongoDB and MongooseJS are used for storing data and accessing it in this project. For styling purposes, SASS is used for making CSS code as structured as possible. No UI library is being used, all styling is done by me from scratch. Overall, the whole project is built following the MVC architecture for sustainable and reusable code.
